The aim of this project is to teach a language (Irish) to players while they play.
It is part of my final year dissertation project - "The Role of User Experience in Language Learning through Video Games"

## Project set-up

# Install Godot Engine
To install the Godot game engine, go to the site: https://godotengine.org/download/ and download the latest stable version for your target platform.

# Clone this repository to your machine

# Open the Project in Godot
Launch the Godot application, then from within the Project Manager select this project. Likely listed as "Irish Language Game"

# Run the Project
In order to run the project correctly, go to Project > Project Settings > Application > Run then select the scene "world.tscn" as the main scene.
Once this is done, you can then run the game by clicking the play icon in the top right of the Godot engine editor. Or alternatively, run it with 'Command+B' (for Mac) or  'Ctrl+B' (for Windows).

# Playing the Game
To interact with NPCs or other objects in the game world press the 'E' key.
You can move your character through the use of WASD or simply using the arrow keys.
Other elements of the game can also be interacted with through means of clicking with the mouse.
To select and place a card, left-click on the card and then drag with the mouse, left-click again to place the card
into a valid card zone. You can also right-click when dragging a card to deselect it.
